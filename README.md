Easy remote control media function over serial port

What?

This application provide simple way to receive any string commands from any serial port and do some action with keyboard like volume up and down, etc. There are many build-in commands which can be mapped to your commands.

Why?
I just need control media functions on my PC using arduino. I know that arduina can be flashed to support HID standard but i haven't version that support this. Fortunatelly arduino support serial communication nativelly and it is easy to use.
